After I learned the basics of JavaScript in 2014, I decided to build an abacus as a practice project. Now that I'm practicing TypeScript I decided to convert the project from JavaScript to TypeScript.

###### How to Use
1. Import `abacus.js` into your project
2. Create a new instance of the class
3. Initialize the abacus
